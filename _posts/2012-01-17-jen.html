      <p>This annual report marks a change in the City of Asheville IT Services Department’s annual reporting. In previous years, we reported on calendar years rather than fiscal years. But, in the spirit of continuous improvement, we have moved the annual report to the fiscal year to better reflect our business model, and to more accurately report on resources allocated during this period of time. As you read through this report, remember that it reflects a period of July 2011 through June 2012, which is the same as the City’s budget year. This change allowed us to accurately indicate funding levels for this accomplishment period.</p> 
     
      <p>FY12 was a challenging time for IT Services. We experienced an increase in demand, a changing and more demanding information security environment, relatively flat resourcing, service outages, and worked to overcome implementation issues with a new regional utility billing system. But it was also a time of significant accomplishment, where staff innovated in ways that reduced and avoided costs for the City of Asheville taxpayer, met City Council goals, and received national recognition for meeting these goals.</p>
               
      <p>FY12 was also the first time that we’ve organized a community event. It’s an unusual role for a government IT service organization to take! But in a time of shrinking resources and increasing demand, we’ve seen that partnerships outside of our four walls have taught us how to do more with less. And, we believe passionately that when we reach out to the technology community, that we not only help the community that we serve, but also end up as smarter, more capable technologists, better able to fulfill the operational and financial expectations that citizens and our fellow employees have for us.</p>

 
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
